Learn about New York City parking regulations. The following is a partial list of parking rules and regulations: Double Parking It is illegal to double park passenger vehicles at all times, including when street cleaning is occurring, regardless of location, purpose or duration. An occupied illegally parked vehicle causes the same safety hazard and congestion as an unoccupied vehicle. Commercial vehicles may double park to make quick pick-ups, deliveries, or service calls during posted hours only. More details are in the City's NYC Traffic Rules in Chapter 4, Section 4-08, subdivision (f), paragraph (1) of the Rules of the City of New York. Parking by a Fire Hydrant It is illegal to park within 15 feet of either side of a fire hydrant. The painted curbs at hydrant locations do not show where a vehicle can park. Parking by a Standpipe A standpipe is the two-headed pipe in front of every mid-rise and high-rise building in New York City. It is often red, but could be another color. Standpipes are not considered hydrants. You can park in front of a standpipe. Parking in the Same Spot for Over Seven Days Unless a posted sign says otherwise, you may not leave a vehicle parked in the same spot for more than seven days in a row. This rule includes spots in all types of neighborhoods, including residential areas. Commercial Vehicle Street Storage Unless posted signs say otherwise, commercial vehicles may not be parked on any street for more than 3 hours. Commercial Vehicle Overnight Parking Commercial vehicles may not park on a residential street between 9 PM and 5 AM. Definition of a Commercial Vehicle or Truck The City's definition of commercial vehicles and trucks determines how you can park and operate your vehicle on City roadways. Yellow taxis and vehicles with TLC plates are not considered commercial vehicles. New York City Traffic Rules define trucks and commercial vehicles as: Truck : any vehicle or combination of vehicles designed for the transportation of property that has 2 axles and 6 tires, or 3 or more axles. At least one of the vehicles has commercial plates. Commercial Vehicle : any vehicle with commercial plates that has been permanently altered to facilitate the transportation of property, and that has the registrant's name on the door or side panels. School Bus Parking A school bus is not considered a commercial vehicle. According to the City's Traffic Rules, school buses can park at any time, including overnight, at a parking spot in front of and within the building lines of a public or private school. Motorcycle, Motor Scooter, and Moped Parking When you park a motorcycle, motor scooter, or moped, you must follow the same rules that apply to other vehicles. It is illegal to park motorcycles, motor scooters, and mopeds on the sidewalk. You may park a motorcycle, motor scooter, or moped at an angle to the curb. If you park at an angle, at least one wheel must touch the curb and no portion of the vehicle may be more than 6 feet from the curb. RV or Motor Home Parking If you park an RV or motor home in a metered space, you only need to pay the front meter. Different rules apply if the RV or motor home is registered for commercial use.",

Our Story One number uniting all New Yorkers How do you bring services from over 200 agencies and non-profits to 8 million people speaking more than 175 languages, all while providing world-class customer service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year? This was the challenge our team faced when the project to launch the nation’s largest 311 system was announced. A Revolution in Public Services To take on this massive challenge, we had to make a simple, yet groundbreaking shift in how government views the public. New Yorkers are more than just residents. They are our neighbors and live and work in diverse communities. But crucially, they are also customers. They deserve the best experience at each step of the process with government—the same as they would receive at a top private sector company. We made it NYC311’s mission to provide that best service and make it easy for everyone to access resources that would allow them to live, work, learn, and thrive. With this change in thinking and purpose, the hard work began. One City, One Number Together, our team: Consolidated more than 40 existing helplines, representing 14 pages in the phone book Helped City Agencies set service standards and time commitments to respond to requests Created thousands of entries in our content database Trained more than 100 representatives Finally, at 12:01 AM, on March 9th, 2003, we received our first call—a complaint about a noisy party in Jackson Heights. With one number uniting all New Yorkers, the days of fumbling through a phone book to figure out how to contact just the right person at the right City office were over. Meeting the Times For over 20 years, the story of NYC311 has been the story of New Yorkers—both our customers and our team serving them. It’s also a story of meeting the times. Since our launch, we’ve expanded to multiple channels to meet our customers where they are. Our innovative, customer-driven culture has transformed the way government delivers services and has served as a model for cities around the world. Through blizzards, blackouts, and a world-wide pandemic, we’ve remained a lifeline for New York City. And we’ll continue to be here for you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.
